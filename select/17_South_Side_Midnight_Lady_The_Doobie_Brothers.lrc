[00:17.01] Up all night, I could not sleep
[00:21.49] The whiskey that I drank was cheap
[00:25.61] With shakin' hands I went and I lit up my last cigarette
[00:33.72] Well the sun came, the night had fled
[00:38.70] And sleepy-eyed I reached my bed
[00:42.93] I saw you sleepy dreamin' there all covered and warm
[01:08.93] 
[00:52.15] South City midnight lady
[00:56.20] I'm much obliged, indeed
[01:00.72] You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need
[01:08.82] I thought there was no reason
[01:13.35] For all these things I do
[01:17.12] But the smile that I sent out returned with you
[01:40.62] 
[01:26.06] When day has left the night behind
[01:30.10] And shadows roll across my mind
[01:34.19] I sometimes find myself alone, out walking the streets
[01:42.25] Yes, and when I'm feeling down and blue
[01:47.08] Then all I do is think of you
[01:51.39] And all my foolish problems seem to fade away
[02:13.89] 
[01:59.85] South City midnight lady
[02:04.24] I'm much obliged, indeed
[02:08.34] You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need
[02:16.54] I thought there was no reason
[02:21.14] For all these things I do
[02:25.28] But the smile that I sent out returned with you
[02:48.78] 
[03:41.44] South City midnight lady
[03:45.41] I'm much obliged, indeed
[03:49.97] You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need
[03:57.72] I thought there was no reason
[04:02.22] For all these things I do
[04:06.34] Yeah, but the smile that I sent out returned with you

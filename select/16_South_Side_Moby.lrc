[00:26.75] See myself in the pouring home
[00:31.02] See the light, come over now
[00:36.51] I see myself in the pouring rain
[00:41.32] I watch hope come over me
[00:53.82] 
[00:46.09] Here we are now, going to the east side
[00:50.87] I pick up my friends and we start to ride
[00:55.95] Ride all night and we ride all day
[01:01.04] Some may come, no but some may stay
[01:18.54] 
[01:11.41] Here we are in the pouring home
[01:15.15] I watch the light man fall the comb
[01:20.70] I watch a light move across the screen
[01:25.88] I watch the light come over me
[01:40.88] 
[01:30.46] Here we are now going to the west side
[01:35.48] Weapons in hand as we go for a ride
[01:40.54] Some may come, no but some may stay
[01:45.68] Watching out for a sunny day
[01:59.68] 
[01:49.92] Where there's love and darkness
[01:54.25] And my sidearm, hey, Elan, Elan
[02:09.75] 
[02:34.97] Here we are now going to the north side
[02:39.51] I look at my friends as they start to ride
[02:44.65] Ride at night and we ride all day
[02:49.65] Looking out for a sunny day
[03:03.15] 
[02:54.63] Here we are now going to the south side
[02:59.48] I pick up my friends and we hope we won't die
[03:04.44] Ride at night, ride through heaven and hell
[03:09.69] Come back, love, and feel so well

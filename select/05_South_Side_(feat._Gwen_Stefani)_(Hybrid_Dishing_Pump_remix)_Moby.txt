See myself in the pouring home
See the light, come over now
I see myself in the pouring rain
I watch hope come over me

Here we are now, going to the East side
I pick up my friends and we start to ride
Ride all night and we ride all day
Some may come, no but some may stay

Here we are in the pouring home
I watch the light man fall the comb
I watch a light move across the screen
I watch the light come over me

Here we are now going to the West side
Weapons in hand as we go for a ride
Some may come, no but some may stay
Watching out for a sunny day

Where there's love and darkness
And my sidearm, hey, Elan, Elan

Here we are now going to the North side
I look at my friends as they start to ride
Ride at night and we ride all day
Looking out for a sunny day

Here we are now going to the South side
I pick up my friends and we hope we won't die
Ride at night, ride through Heaven and Hell
Come back, love and feel so well
